		Content Management System (CMS) is typically defined as 
		a tool to manage assets. Is a CMS tool really just a commoditized 
		utility to manage assets? Why do we need to manage assets? Shouldnâ€™t we be 
		managing customers? The customers that visit our website exhibit distinct behavioral 
		patterns, and we should be creating and optimizing these assets based on a scientific, 
		repeatable process that allows us to optimize the customer experience for the 96% of visitors 
		that abandon your website without accomplishing their goal.
